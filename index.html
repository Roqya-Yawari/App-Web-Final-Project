              I am Roqya Yawari. I was born in Jaghori district of Ghazni
              province in 2003 and when I completed the second grade, we moved
              to Herat city, the place that I am graduated from High school in
              2021. At school, I had the first position from first grade until
              12th grade and the score of my 10,11, and 12th grade is 99.35%.
              <br />
              <br />
              Fortunately, I passed the Kankor exam in 2022 and got 309 marks
              and accepted in my favorite field Computer Science and in IT
              department. Happily, I could complete the 2 semesters of this
              field before the Taliban government.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now, I am working on my developer skills and have learned the
              basics of web development like: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS and
              started JavaScript. I am trying to learn as much as I can sothat
              can be a useful person for my society and world.
